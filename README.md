# Phys-489-Project-temp-title

This is a research project on new metrics for evaluating research papers. We limited our scope to physics papers only.

Steps:

~ Pull as much data a possible from openAlex. I used an OpenAlex scraper for this. We are also writing scripts to do that. 
~ Next we used the DOI's to check if the paper has been retracted using crossref or retraction watch.
~ Check if data is available (i.e RDM)
~ Start comparing abstracts
